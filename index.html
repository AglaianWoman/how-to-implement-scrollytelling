			<h1 class='hed'>How to implement scrollytelling with six different libraries</h1>
			<p class='byline'>

			<p>
				<strong>Scrollytelling is the best</strong> (or the worst depending on your <a target='_blank' href='https://eagereyes.org/blog/2016/the-scrollytelling-scourge'>point of view</a>). We love it here at <a target='_blank' href='https://pudding.cool'>The Pudding</a>. But creating a scroll-driven story is hardly a standardize practice, and there are many libraries out there that can help make it happen.
			</p>
			<p>So that we are on the same page, I refer to &ldquo;scrollytelling&rdquo; as when content (eg. a graphic) is revealed or changes as the user scrolls. It does not alter scroll behavior, but simply monitors it. As Martha Stewart would say, it's a good thing. Do not confuse this will scrolljacking, which manipulates the browser&rsquo;s scroll mecahnics with JavaScript, and is generally considered bad practice.
			</p> 
			<p>
				<strong>In this post, I look at how to tackle a simple scroll-driven chart using six different libraries</strong>, and share my thoughts on each implementation. It is inspired by Lisa Charlotte Rost&rsquo;s <a target='_blank' href='https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/'>great post</a> comparing charting libraries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm not going to get into the different types of scrollytelling, or debate the serious ethical and moral implications of the practice. I defer to <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/@zanarmstrong/why-choose-scrollytelling-steppers-155a59dd97fe'>these</a> <a target='_blank' href='http://vallandingham.me/scroll_talk/examples/'>posts</a> for scrollytelling primers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<video class='video-demo' src='assets/demo.mp4' preload autoplay loop></video>
				We have two goals here: <br>
				1. Use the "scroll-to-trigger" pattern where trigger element (in our case a block of text) tells the chart to update to a new state. <br>
				2. We want the chart to stay fixed while the text moves, and have it snap back into place as it enters and exits.

				Disclaimer: <em>this post does not cover responsive solutions (though you should do it, and most libraries make it pretty painless), so if you had the audacity to resize your browser, refresh the page. I'm not going to cover mobile either, which will probably become its own post soon enough...</em>

				<p class='results_graf'>Waypoints is a very solid choice. It has been around for a while, and supports both vanilla JS and jQuery integration. It has an easy to understand API, and good documentation. It has a lot of add-ons, like a debugger extension to reduce some head-scratching, and stuff like inview detection and sticky elements.</p>

				<div class='graphic__vis'></div>
			</div>
			<div class='library__results'>
				<p class='results_graf'>ScrollMagic is based on Superscrollorama, a previously popular library. Like Waypoints, it is quite robust, well-documented, and totally customizable. It has a great add-on for debugging. It also has no dependencies which is nice.</p>

				<p class='results_graf'>graph-scroll.js is a d3 plugin, so only consider it if you are familiar with and using d3. It is really lightweight, and was created by <a href='https://twitter.com/adamrpearce' target='_blank'>Adam Pearce</a> who knows a thing or two about scroll-driven graphics. It is very singularly focused though, so it will likely require you to customize the library a bit to get what you want.</p>

			<div class='library__results'>
				<p class='results_graf'>in-view.js is a great library in general, and I tried to adapt it my scrollytelling needs. While one of its features is perfomance optimization, that comes with the downside of only having a single global offset for triggering an enter/exit. I had to use a <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/gabrielflorit/in-view'>modified version</a> that allows for creating multiple instances to make it work for this scenario. Also, the offsets are a bit confusing to use in this context. In short, this library is amazingly simple to use for just triggering, but definitely not designed for customized scrollytelling.</p>

				<p class='results_graf'>ScrollStory is created by and for the New York Times. It has a super clear API and supports tons of options. The two big drawbacks I found were that it depends on jQuery (which is not a problem if you use by default) and it requires some additional code to get the fixed graphic part working properly.</p>

			<div class='library__results'>
				<p class='results_graf'>When in doubt, roll your own. There will be a bit more coding involved (and some fun math!), but you get to familiarize yourself with the core concepts of how scroll-driven libraries are created. It is all custom, so you can have it do whatever you want. You will want to consider performance optimizations like throttling and such.</p>

		<div class='outro'>
			<p>TLDR; it all depends on what your use case is. For highly customized stories will need either Waypoints, ScrollMagic, or roll your own. Simple d3 projects can take advantage of graph-scroll.js. Really basic stuff can be done with in-view.js.</p>
